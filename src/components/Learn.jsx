                    <p className='font-roboto text-[16px]'>
                    Dyslexia is a LD (Learning Difficulty) that makes it hard to remember what a letter or word looks like and what it sounds like. This means children have trouble reading, writing, and spelling. Since all school work requires reading and writing, the child struggles in every subject.<br/>
                    Dyslexia is not a disease, it is simply a difficulty. It occurs due to many reasons, but the most basic one is that every child is different. The same classroom setting does not work for everyone, and these children can learn very well if we teach them the way they learn ðŸ™‚<br/>
                    Early diagnosis is very important to help the child on time. Dyslexia does not go away, and if we donâ€™t help the child, the problem will only get worse. It will also cause the childâ€™s self-confidence to get low, and they can get anxiety. The problem can only be solved by helping the child learn in the way they learn best, with professional help.<br/>
                    Also, official diagnosis can help get extra time on board exams.<br/>
                    To help the child, you may use the test on this website to see if they are showing symptoms. You may also read more about Dyslexia and see FAQs. You may contact professionals and get an expert opinion. You may also help the child with extra help at home using online resources.
